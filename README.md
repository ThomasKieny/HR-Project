# HR-Project
This project enabled me to start from scratch, with a dataset I found on the Internet about a fake company. I decided to use this data to create dashboards for managers and board members to visualize clear information about the staff in a glance. 

First step: We used a dataset available online (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set) and loaded it in a Jupyter Notebook for some cleaning
Second step: After having partially cleaned the dataset, we opened it in Power BI for some further cleaning and adjustment before creating our dashboards
Third step: Dashboards creation with two different objectives. One dashboard is dedicated to the salaries' expenses of the company. The second dashboard will be used by board members to evaluate managers' teams and performance.
